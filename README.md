# AmongUsPlugin: 2020

Idea:
Minecraft plugin for a venting system similar to Among Us. 
Player is able to switch between certain vent systems and becomes invisible and non-moveable while in vents.

Issues:
Specified to specific world coordinates, not changeable in-game.
Matching world and server files deleted or lost.
